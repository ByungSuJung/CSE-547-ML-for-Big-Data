These codes are about the CSE 547/ STAT 548 homework 1.

To run the script: stat-548-hw1.py, we need to use read_coco.py to prepare 6 csv data files.
The steps are shown below.

1. Change the "dataDir" in read_coco.py to the path that you put your data file on your own computer
2. Uncommand "dataType" to access to train data set to generate the train-data csv files
3. Uncommand "dataType" to access to test data set to generate the test-data csv files, rerun read_coco.py
4. Uncommand "dataType" to access to cv data set to generate the cv-data csv files, rerun read_coco.py
5. Let the "path" in stat-548-hw1.py to be the same as the "dataDir" in read_coco.py
6. Run stat-548-hw1.py and we can get the results.
